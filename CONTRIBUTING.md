# Contribution guidelines
You want to contribute? That's amazing! 
But there are just some simple rules for it.

- Use the official Java Conventions (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html)
- Test your code (Is it working, is the performance good, is the code readable)

That's it. If we don't like any pull-request we just don't merge it with a little message why not.
Have an awesome day!
